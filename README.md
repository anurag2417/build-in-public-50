# 🚀 Build in Public — 50 Projects in 50 Days

Welcome to **build-in-public-50** 👋  
This repository documents my challenge to **build 50 real-world projects in 50 days**, one project every day — openly, consistently, and with focus on learning by doing.

The goal is simple:
> **Ship daily. Learn fast. Improve publicly.**

---

## 📌 Why this challenge?

- Build strong **project consistency**
- Improve **problem-solving & implementation speed**
- Strengthen my **developer portfolio**
- Learn by **shipping, not just consuming**
- Show real progress instead of just certificates

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack (will evolve over time)

Depending on the project, I’ll be using:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- React, Next.js
- Java (backend / logic where applicable)
- APIs & browser features
- Basic system design concepts

Each project mentions its **own tech stack** inside its folder.

## 📈 What I focus on while building

- Clean & readable code
- Proper folder structure
- Realistic use-cases
- Edge cases & failure handling
- Learning **why**, not just **how**

## 🧪 How to run projects locally

Each project includes instructions inside its own folder.  
Most frontend projects can be run by simply opening `index.html` or using a local dev server.
